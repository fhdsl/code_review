As the direct author of the code you will have the most intimate knowledge of the code and project details. This means that your ability to communicate with others in your lab is critical to the smoothness and success of the project.

## General tips:

- It is a skill to know when to ask for help and when you should continue to plug away at a problem on your own. With the help and guidance of your lab manager and/or lab leader, you can work on striking the right balance. On one hand, if you are stuck on a problem that you are making no progress on it is an inefficient use of everyone's time and energy for you to continue to be frustrated -- **definitely reach out for help**! Others want you and your project to succeed and are generally happy to help you!
- If you are in a small lab or a lab that is not very programming proficient, you may need to get creative in finding help. At the data science lab, one of our goals will be to help you get connected with others to collaborate with.
