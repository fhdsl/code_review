As a lab leader, you oversee the lab and are the lead of the projects. You be in charge of gathering funding and mentoring trainees more generally. Your primary responsibilities are to make sure your lab managers and lab developers are set up and supported for success.

We recommend you read through this course on [Leadership for Cancer Informatics Research](https://jhudatascience.org/Informatics_Research_Leadership/introduction.html) by Carrie Wright.

## General tips:  

- As the leader of the lab, your job will be to help guide your lab in prioritizing code review as well as setting up the macro-system for what code review in your lab should look like.
- Where appropriate, we highly suggest you delegate all direct handling of code and code review responsibilities to others in your lab.
- If historically, you've been more directly involved with reviewing code, this means you will have to intentionally take a step back from that role and instead focus on supporting your lab members as they create a collaborative code review atmosphere of their own. Encourage your lab members to heavily communicate and collaborate with each other instead of you. This will be a more efficient use of everyone's time!
- If your lab is particularly small, you may need to reach out to other labs who write code and encourage your lab members to collaborate with them. 

## Tips for fostering a collaborative code development atmosphere

- You likely will want to have a meeting with your lab to set clear expectations about what a code review system will look like in your lab. Whatever system you decide to try, keep it open and clear to your trainees that if something with this system is not working, that they should come to you so as a team you can reevaluate what may need to be tweaked.
- Set aside a special meeting time each week where members can each take turns presenting technical problems.
